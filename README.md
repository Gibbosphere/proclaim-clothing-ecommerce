Implementing a prototype of my niche Christian clothing E-commerce business idea.

## Overview
I noticed a gap in the market that overlapped with two of my passions - fashion and my Christian faith. 
Christian clothing that is stylish, Biblical, and affordable is rare and difficult to find in Cape Town. The currently avaialable Christian clothing market in Cape Town lacks style and does not appeal to the newest fashion trends, specifically surrounding teenagers and young adults. Oversees Christian clothing brands get the style right, but import taxes makes it unnafordable. 

## Implementation Process
So, to confirm my observations about this market gap and implement a protoype e-commerce site I did the following:
1. Used a business canvas to understand the nature of this e-commerce business venture 
2. Performed an extensive UX report
3. Designed website using wireframes
4. Implemented the website prototype using Wix

The entire implementation process can be found in the document [E-commerce business documentation](Individual Niche E-Commerce Project- INF3014F.pdf).
